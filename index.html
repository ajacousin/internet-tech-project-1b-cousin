                <h1>About me</h1>
            
                <p>I’m a senior at Loyola University in New Orleans, studying Music Industry Studies and Public Relations. I grew up in Mandeville, Louisiana. I was brought up in dance, music, and theatre. As an adult, I still seek out new ways to experience the arts. Food and cooking are other passions of mine and I love cooking for others. My favorite way to spend my free time is with coffee and a great book.</p>

                <p>Old-school blues and funk will always have my heart. Some of my favorites are Otis Redding, Al Green, The O’Jays, Earth, Wind & Fire, and Sly and the Family Stone, but the list goes on! My favorite New Orleans restaurant is Parkway Bakery. I am rather sentimental, so the memories of going here as a kid with my dad are extra sweet to me now. Fun fact: It’s not actually a bakery. They have really good po’boys and the old-fashioned Barq’s root beers.</p>
                <p>In recent years, I’ve had the chance to work with great professionals. I started public relations work in 2020, and since then I’ve gathered strategic marketing and digital management skills and experiences to take this generation of public relations to the next level. Browse my Portfolio to get a better idea of the kind of work I’ve been involved with. Have questions? Contact me.</p>
